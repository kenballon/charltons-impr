        <h2 class="mb-3">Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Kim is involved primarily in advising clients in relation to Hong Kong’s regulatory regime under the
            Companies
            Ordinance, the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the Securities and Futures
            Ordinance, the Listing Rules and the Codes on Takeovers, Mergers and Share Buy-backs. Her practice areas
            include
            advising in relation to applications to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, applications to be licensed by
            the
            SFC under the SFO and on-going regulatory compliance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kim is particularly interested in regulatory change aimed at ensuring Hong Kong’s continued development as
            an
            international financial centre and the prime gateway for the flow of investment between Mainland China and
            the
            rest of the world. Hong Kong stands to benefit enormously from China’s continued opening up. It will
            therefore
            be extremely interesting to see how Hong Kong’s laws and regulatory regime adapt to enable Hong Kong to
            capitalise on the liberalisation occurring in the Mainland market. It is with that in mind that Kim became
            interested in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Concept Paper on Weighted Voting Rights which sought views on
            whether the Listing Rules should be changed to allow the listing of companies, like Alibaba Group, whose
            governance structures give certain persons voting or other rights disproportionate to their shareholders.
            Kim
            was involved in responding to the Concept Paper on behalf of various Hong Kong sponsor and securities firms.
