        <p>A company that is not incorporated in Hong Kong may make an application under section 820B of the Companies
            Ordinance (Cap. 622 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (the “Companies Ordinance”) to be registered as a re-domiciled
            company in Hong Kong. A successful application would result in the non-Hong Kong company relocating its
            legal domicile from its place of original domicile to Hong Kong while preserving its corporate identity,
            operational continuity, and pre-existing legal obligations.</p>
        <p class="para-note">Note: The company applying to be re-domiciled to Hong Kong is referred to in this note as
            the “non-Hong Kong company” or “company” depending on the context in which they are used. </p>

        <h2>Eligibility Requirements </h2>
        <p>The non-Hong Kong company to be re-domiciled to Hong Kong must meet the following requirements to be eligible
            to apply for re-domiciliation: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>the non-Hong Kong company must either be a private or public company limited by shares or an unlimited
                private or public company with a share capital;</li>
            <li>the non-Hong Kong company has been incorporated for at least one financial year;</li>
            <li>the laws of the original place of incorporation permits re-domiciling out of the jurisdiction and does
                not prohibit re-domiciling to Hong Kong, and the non-Hong Kong company has complied with those laws;
            </li>
            <li>the re-domiciliation application is not intended to defraud creditors and is made in good faith;</li>
            <li>all shareholder approval and other consent requirements under the laws of the original place of
                incorporation, constitutional documents (e.g. Memorandum and Articles of Association) and/or contracts
                or undertakings have been obtained or waived (as applicable); </li>
            <li>shareholder approval requirements under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance are met; </li>
            <li>all creditors have been notified of the re-domiciliation proposal;</li>
            <li>the non-Hong Kong company is able to pay its debts which fall due within the period of 12 months from
                the application date; and</li>
            <li>the non-Hong Kong company (a) is not the subject of any petition, proceedings or order for the winding
                up or liquidation of the non-Hong Kong company; (b) has not passed any resolution for winding up or
                liquidation; (c) has not been notified of the appointment of any receiver or manager with respect to the
                non-Hong Kong company and/or its assets and there is no person acting as such; or (d) has not entered
                into any scheme, order, comprise or arrangement relating to the insolvency of the non-Hong Kong company.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Hong Kong Companies Registrar will refuse a re-domiciliation application if it is of the opinion that the
            company will be likely to be used for an unlawful purpose or a purpose contrary to public interest after
            re-domiciling to Hong Kong.</p>
