        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As of 23 May 2025, Hong Kong has introduced a new corporate re-domiciliation regime
            under the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2023, now incorporated into Part
            17A of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) (the “CO”). This development permits eligible
            non-Hong Kong incorporated entities to transfer their place of incorporation to Hong Kong
            and continue as companies incorporated under Hong Kong law. A full summary of the law
            and requirements is set out <a href="/media/redomicile/Redomiciling%20a%20company%20to%20Hong%20Kong.pdf"

            domiciling to Hong Kong, drawing on our extensive experience in cross-border corporate
            structuring and Hong Kong company law. Download our guide on redomicling companies to

        <h2>What is Company Re-domiciliation? </h2>
        <p>Re-domiciliation enables a foreign company to change its place of incorporation to Hong
            Kong without the need to wind up in its original jurisdiction or establish a new Hong Kong
            company from scratch. Once registered in Hong Kong under section 820C of the CO, the re-
            domiciled entity is treated in law as a Hong Kong-incorporated company, subject to the
            rights, obligations, and compliance requirements under the CO, unless otherwise specified.</p>

        <h2>Key Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <p>To qualify for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong, a company must, among other things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be permitted under its existing jurisdiction’s laws to transfer its domicile and comply with
                the relevant local requirements;</li>
            <li>Be of a substantially similar company type as those recognised under the CO;</li>
            <li>Have completed at least one financial year since incorporation;</li>
            <li>Satisfy solvency and good faith requirements;</li>
            <li>Ensure the application is not intended to defraud creditors or contravene public interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eligible company types for re-domiciliation include private or public companies limited by
            shares, as well as unlimited companies with share capital. </p>
        <h2>Application Procedure</h2>
        <p>Applicants must submit to the Registrar of Companies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A completed Re-domiciliation Form (Form NNC6);​</li>
            <li>A certified copy of the proposed articles of association;​</li>
            <li>A legal opinion from counsel qualified in the original jurisdiction;</li>
            <li>Supporting constitutional, financial, and compliance documents; and​</li>
            <li>A Notice to the Business Registration Office (Form IRBR5).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Applications may be filed either electronically or in hard copy. A Certificate of Re-
            domiciliation and Business Registration Certificate will be issued upon successful
            registration. </p>

        <h2>Post-Registration Obligations</h2>
        <p>Following re-domiciliation, the company must:​</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Effect deregistration in its original jurisdiction within 120 days;​</li>
            <li>Comply with all statutory filing requirements under Hong Kong law, including filings
                relating to directors, members, and charges; and​</li>
            <li>Maintain ongoing compliance as required of all companies incorporated in Hong Kong.</li>
        </ul>
