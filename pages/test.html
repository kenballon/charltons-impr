        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As of 23 May 2025, Hong Kong has introduced a new corporate re-domiciliation regime
            under the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance 2023, now incorporated into Part
            17A of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) (the “CO”). This development permits eligible
            non-Hong Kong incorporated entities to transfer their place of incorporation to Hong Kong
            and continue as companies incorporated under Hong Kong law. A full summary of the law
            and requirements is set out <a href="/hong-kong-company-re-domiciliation-regime-effective-on-23-may-2025/"
                class="default_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>At Charltons, we advise international clients on all legal and procedural aspects of re-
            domiciling to Hong Kong, drawing on our extensive experience in cross-border corporate
            structuring and Hong Kong company law. Download our guide on redomicling companies to
            Hong Kong and our focused country guides on redomiciling Cayman [link], British Virgin
            Islands [Link], Bermuda [Link] companies to Hong Kong. </p>

        <h2>What is Company Re-domiciliation? </h2>
        <p>Re-domiciliation enables a foreign company to change its place of incorporation to Hong
            Kong without the need to wind up in its original jurisdiction or establish a new Hong Kong
            company from scratch. Once registered in Hong Kong under section 820C of the CO, the re-
            domiciled entity is treated in law as a Hong Kong-incorporated company, subject to the
            rights, obligations, and compliance requirements under the CO, unless otherwise specified.</p>

        <h2>Key Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <p>To qualify for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong, a company must, among other things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be permitted under its existing jurisdiction’s laws to transfer its domicile and comply with
                the relevant local requirements;</li>
            <li>Be of a substantially similar company type as those recognised under the CO;</li>
            <li>Have completed at least one financial year since incorporation;</li>
            <li>Satisfy solvency and good faith requirements;</li>
            <li>Ensure the application is not intended to defraud creditors or contravene public interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eligible company types for re-domiciliation include private or public companies limited by
            shares, as well as unlimited companies with share capital. </p>
        <h2>Application Procedure</h2>
        <p>Applicants must submit to the Registrar of Companies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A completed Re-domiciliation Form (Form NNC6);​</li>
            <li>A certified copy of the proposed articles of association;​</li>
            <li>A legal opinion from counsel qualified in the original jurisdiction;</li>
            <li>Supporting constitutional, financial, and compliance documents; and​</li>
            <li>A Notice to the Business Registration Office (Form IRBR5).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Applications may be filed either electronically or in hard copy. A Certificate of Re-
            domiciliation and Business Registration Certificate will be issued upon successful
            registration. </p>

        <h2>Post-Registration Obligations</h2>
        <p>Following re-domiciliation, the company must:​</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Effect deregistration in its original jurisdiction within 120 days;​</li>
            <li>Comply with all statutory filing requirements under Hong Kong law, including filings
                relating to directors, members, and charges; and​</li>
            <li>Maintain ongoing compliance as required of all companies incorporated in Hong Kong.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Re-domicile Your Company to Hong Kong</h1>
        <h2>Thinking of relocating your corporate base to Hong Kong?​</h2>
        <p>
            As of May 2025, companies incorporated outside Hong Kong can now re-domicile to Hong
            Kong under a new statutory regime. This means eligible foreign companies can transfer their
            incorporation to Hong Kong and continue as if originally formed in Hong Kong —without the
            need to wind up or re-incorporate.
        </p>

        <h2>Why re-domicile to Hong Kong?​</h2>
        <p>
            Hong Kong offers a robust legal framework, world-class financial infrastructure, and unrivalled
            access to Asian and global markets. With its new re-domiciliation regime, it’s easier than ever to
            establish a corporate presence in this premier international business hub.
