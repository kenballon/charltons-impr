    <h2 class="mb-3">Biography</h2>
    Kim is involved primarily in advising clients in relation to Hong Kong’s regulatory regime under the Companies
    Ordinance, the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the Securities and Futures Ordinance,
    the Listing Rules and the Codes on Takeovers, Mergers and Share Buy-backs. Her practice areas include advising in
    relation to applications to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, applications to be licensed by the SFC under the
    SFO and on-going regulatory compliance.

    Kim is particularly interested in regulatory change aimed at ensuring Hong Kong’s continued development as an
    international financial centre and the prime gateway for the flow of investment between Mainland China and the rest
    of the world. Hong Kong stands to benefit enormously from China’s continued opening up. It will therefore be
    extremely interesting to see how Hong Kong’s laws and regulatory regime adapt to enable Hong Kong to capitalise on
    the liberalisation occurring in the Mainland market. It is with that in mind that Kim became interested in the Hong
    Kong Stock Exchange’s Concept Paper on Weighted Voting Rights which sought views on whether the Listing Rules should
    be changed to allow the listing of companies, like Alibaba Group, whose governance structures give certain persons
    voting or other rights disproportionate to their shareholders. Kim was involved in responding to the Concept Paper
    on behalf of various Hong Kong sponsor and securities firms.
