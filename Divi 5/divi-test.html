        <p>Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets are governed by the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), which
            was implemented in April 2003 to consolidate and modernise the previous legislation. Other transactions,
            such as initial public offerings, are also regulated by the Companies Ordinance (CO).</p>
        <p>We advise on all aspects of the SFO and the CO. The key areas include:</p>
